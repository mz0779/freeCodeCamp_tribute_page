      <h3>Hear's a timeline of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) life:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li><strong>c. 570</strong> - Abu al-Qasim Muhammad (ﷺ) ibn Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim was born in Mecca. His birthday is believed to be in the month of Rabi' al-awwal. He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan, part of the Quraysh tribe, which was one of Mecca's prominent families</li>
           <li><strong>c. 610</strong> - Muhammad (ﷺ) began to pray alone in a cave named Hira on Mount Jabal al-Nour, near Mecca for several weeks every year. Islamic tradition holds that during one of his visits to that cave, in the year 610 the angel Gabriel appeared to him and commanded Muhammad (ﷺ) to recite verses that would be included in the Quran. Consensus exists that the first Quranic words revealed were the beginning of Quran 96:1.</li>
           <li><strong>c. 620</strong> - Muhammad (ﷺ) experienced the Isra and Mi'raj, a miraculous night-long journey said to have occurred with the angel Gabriel. At the journey's beginning, the Isra, he is said to have traveled from Mecca on a winged steed to "the farthest mosque." Later, during the Mi'raj, Muhammad (ﷺ) is said to have toured heaven and hell, and spoke with earlier prophets, such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.</li>
           <li><strong>c. 622</strong> - The Hijra is the migration of Muhammad (ﷺ) and his followers from Mecca to Medina in. In June 622, warned of a plot to assassinate him, Muhammad (ﷺ) secretly slipped out of Mecca and moved his followers to Medina, 450 kilometres (280 miles) north of Mecca</li>
           <li><strong>c. 630</strong> - Muhammad (ﷺ) began to prepare for a campaign. In 630, Muhammad (ﷺ) marched on Mecca with 10,000 Muslim converts. With minimal casualties, Muhammad (ﷺ) seized control of Mecca. He declared an amnesty for past offences, except for ten men and women who were "guilty of murder or other offences or had sparked off the war and disrupted the peace". Some of these were later pardoned. Most Meccans converted to Islam and Muhammad (ﷺ) proceeded to destroy all the statues of Arabian gods in and around the Kaaba</li>
           <li><strong>c.632</strong> - At the end of the tenth year after migration to Medina, Muhammad (ﷺ) completed his first true Islamic pilgrimage, setting precedent for the annual Great Pilgrimage, known as Hajj. On the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah Muhammad (ﷺ) delivered his Farewell Sermon, at Mount Arafat east of Mecca. In this sermon, Muhammad (ﷺ) advised his followers not to follow certain pre-Islamic customs. For instance, he said a white has no superiority over a black, nor a black any superiority over a white except by piety and good action. He abolished old blood feuds and disputes based on the former tribal system and asked for old pledges to be returned as implications of the creation of the new Islamic community. Commenting on the vulnerability of women in his society, Muhammad (ﷺ) asked his male followers to "be good to women, for they are powerless captives (awan) in your households. You took them in God's trust, and legitimated your sexual relations with the Word of God, so come to your senses people, and hear my words ..." He told them that they were entitled to discipline their wives but should do so with kindness. He addressed the issue of inheritance by forbidding false claims of paternity or of a client relationship to the deceased and forbade his followers to leave their wealth to a testamentary heir. He also upheld the sacredness of four lunar months in each year. According to Sunni tafsir, the following Quranic verse was delivered during this event: <b>"Today I have perfected your religion, and completed my favours for you and chosen Islam as a religion for you"</b></li>
         
         <li><strong>c. 632</strong> - A few months after the farewell pilgrimage, Muhammad (ﷺ) fell ill and suffered for several days with fever, head pain, and weakness. He died on Monday, 8 June 632, in Medina, at the age of 62 or 63, in the house of his wife Aisha. With his head resting on Aisha's lap, he asked her to dispose of his last worldly goods (seven coins)</li>
